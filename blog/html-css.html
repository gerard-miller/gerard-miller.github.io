     Relative, Absolute and Fixed positioning are all different CSS positioning types. whenever using the CSS key elements they are always positioned using four key aspects. Top, right, bottom and left.

    </p>
    <p>
    Relative positioning is always positioned according to itself. Selecting to position an element to the left, right, top and bottom will move it away from itself depending on the set parameters. Conversley a negative symbol will move the image in the opposite relative to where it was originally.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> <img src="relative 2.png"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>
    <p>
    <br>Fixed positioning means that certain elements are always fixed according to the viewport (browser window). The parent element is always the viewport. Even when the page is scrolled up or down then the element will stay in the same position. So the code will shift the element like this
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> <img src="fixed 2.png" sizes="" srcset="">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
</p>

    <p>
    Absolute positioning elements are positioned according to the nearest containing element. So it is not positioned to itself but similar to fixed positioning, absolute positioning is found in a containing element. When working with absolute positioning there is always two elements that are being used. The parent element is the containing parameters in which the box element will be manipulated around. For example  
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> <img src="absolute 2.png" alt="" sizes="" srcset="">
</font>
</center>
