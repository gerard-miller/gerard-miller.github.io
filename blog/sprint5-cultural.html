            learning?</h2>
        <p class="blog-1-para">

            <li>I have found that i have learnt a lot about myself over this process and i have been out of my comfort
                in many aspeects of the course. This had lead me to to realise that i need to start doing more thungs
                that put me out of my comfort zone.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have learnt that i am very resiliant in terms of being able to put my head down and keep going even
                when things are quite hard.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have learnt that i need to be far more organised it many aspects of my life.</li>
            <br>
            <li>From core learning i have learnt the importance of trying to constantly look back and reflect when i do
                things in my life. </li>

        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-1-para">Values have a huge part to play in terms of learning and programming. If you value
            programing you will strive to learn it. Your drive in ability to want to learn something is proportinate to
            how much you value and desire something.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Empathy is important in any aspect in life especially in programming. Empathy plays a important role when you
            work with others in helping them to make them feel comfortable to learn and understand. Empathy towards
            yourself is also very important.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Self awareness is a very important aspect. Without Self awarness you can not develop other keys aspects of
            your life like your strengths and weaknesses. This can help you to become a better learner and programmer.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning</h3>
        <p class="blog-1-para">
            <br>The things that have learned from my core learning is the deeper understanding that i have about myself.
            Core learning gave me the tools to access different parts of myself. It also gave me a range of tools in the
            way that i interact with other people and dealing with tricky situations.</br>


        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p class="blog-1-para"> In terms of core learning the most challenging aspects i find probably are sharing emotions with others as i am bit of an introvert. Looking at yourself can also be quite uncomfortable at times as well.
        </br>
        <br> 
        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p class="blog-1-para"> As a programaing school i beleive that so much time is spent focussing on programaing as employers beleive that this is an extremely important aspect of future programers. If people dont understand the importance of things like empathy then they will not make good working team members.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p class="blog-1-para"> No it defenitly is not a waste of time. Personal skils and relationship skills do not always come easily to some people and to be great fuctional memebrs for employers than they must be able to great understanding of themselves and others.</p>
