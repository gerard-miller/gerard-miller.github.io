        <h1 id="main-heading">My Identity and Values</h1>

            <h2 class="blog-1-heading">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
                <p class="blog-1-para">An ethical situation that i have had to make has been when i was working for a roofing company a few years back. I found myself in a situation where I was accidentally overpaid a significant amount of money. The money looked nice sitting in my bank account but I knew what the right thing was to do. Although nothing was said to me I approached my boss and told him of the mix up, he thanked me very much and I returned the money. I feel he also gained a lot of trust for me from this situation. Another example of an ethical situation I found myself in was when I was working on a cotton farm in Australia. While I was driving a tractor one of the forks smashed and put a hole in the tank and it exploded. I immediately told my boss who was thankful I owned up and told him straight away.

            <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para"> My culture as a New Zealander has had a major impact on my values and identity. As a New Zealander I believe that on the whole we have strong values and moral compass. We are a small nation of 5 million people and many of our actions reverberate back to us quickly. We live in a small world where everyone knows what we do which inherently keeps us accountable. As New Zealanders we live so far away from other countries so this creates a unique ecosystem in which our own values and identity can grow in a unique way. Naturally growing up in this environment I portray this culture and identity in who I am and what I do. I am proud to be a New Zealander but in the same way it does not define who I am. I do not parade an all blacks jersey and green stone when I travel overseas but am proud to accept the warm regard in which people hold me when they learn I am from New Zealand.

             <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Strengths </h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para">I feel that I am very independent in what I do and think.
<br></br>
                    <br> I am not afraid of conflict and standing up for myself and what I believe is right. I don't back down easily from someone or something that is difficult.</br>
                    
                    <br> I feel that another strength I have is that I am very empathetic and intuitive to what others are feeling and thinking.</br>
                      </p>  
             <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Limitations</h3>  
                <p class="blog-1-para">I struggle at times to break things down into smaller, more manageable tasks.</p>  
                <br> I often get stuck on certain things and will not ask for help or try to figure out what the next logical step to take is.</br>
            <br> My time management is not always the best. things probably take me a lot longer to finish then what they probably should.</br>
                <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Collaborative work</h3> 
                <p class="blog-1-para"> When I am working in a team I tend to be pretty easy going until I feel that a decision is being made that appears like it will ultimately lead down the wrong direction. I am happy to voice my concerns but if I feel that I am not being heard or dismissed I can become stubborn or confrontational. I have become better at being objective and stepping back and realising that I may not always be right and trying to see the situation from the other person's point of view. Often when I do this I become more understanding and sympathetic as I see why others think a certain way about a situation.
