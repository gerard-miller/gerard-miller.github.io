            <h3 class="blog-1-heading"> What is the significance of emotional intelligence?</h3> 
                <p class="blog-1-para">We all know that the most accomplished and content people in life aren't necessarily the sharpest. You probably know someone who is intellectually brilliant but socially awkward and fails at job or in their individual connections. Intelligence, or your intelligence quotient (IQ), isn't enough to attain achievement on its own.
 </p>     
        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Emotional intelligence has an impact on: 
        </h3> 
            <p class="blog-1-para">Your academic or professional performance. Strong  emotional intelligence can assist you in navigating the social difficulties of the job, leading and motivating people, and achieving professional success. In fact, many firms now consider emotional intelligence being as significant as technical aptitude when evaluating critical job candidates and use EQ testing before employment.
                <br></br> Your bodily well-being. If you can't control your emotions, it's likely that you can't control your stress. This can result in major health issues. Uncontrolled stress elevates blood pressure, inhibits the immune system, boosts the risk of heart attacks and strokes, causes infertility, and accelerates the ageing process. Learning how to improve emotional intelligence is the first step.
<br></br>Your psychological well-being. Unchecked emotions and stress will have a negative impact on mental health, putting you at risk for anxiety and depression. You'll find it difficult to create strong connections if you can't comprehend, accept, or control your emotions. This might make you feel lonely and sad, exacerbating whatever mental health issues you may have.
   <br></br>Your friendships. You'll be better equipped to express yourself and comprehend how others feel if you understand your feelings and how to manage them. This enables us to communicate very effectively and build deeper relationships across both your professional and personal lives.         
          <br></br> Your social awareness. Being in touch with your emotions is a social benefit, as it allows you to connect with others and around you. You can identify a friend from an enemy, gauge another person's interest in you, relieve stress, regulate your nervous system through social dialogue, and feel appreciated and happy if you have social intelligence.
<br></br>Emotional intelligence is a set of skills that can be learned at any moment. It's crucial to realise, though, that there's a difference between knowing about EQ and implementing it to your life. Just because you know you need to do something doesn't guarantee you will—especially if you're stressed, which might overrule your desired impact.In order to maintain emotional awareness, you must learn how to overcome stressful situations and in your interactions in order to continuously change behaviour in ways that stand up under pressure.
