        <p>There are many facets that make up the world of web development. These facets all interact with each other in an important way to make a functional and creative web page.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-1-heading">The differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p class="blog-1-para"> Two important elements to understand are HTML and CSS. HTML is the cake then CSS is the icing. An analogy is a great way for non-technical to establish a basic understanding of a complicated concept. An analogy that could be used to describe them both is the idea of a house. A house has rooms, doors, a roof and a floor. Similarly a website uses a type of room or sections for example a header, body and footer. HTML is what organises these areas into a hierarchy. 
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>To make the rooms and everything inside of it look cool, unique and creative is where CSS comes into play. CSS describes colours, shapes and positions of certain elements in a website.</p>
  <br></br>
  <p>The way in which you interact with aspects of a home such as turning lights on or off or adjusting the temperature on the central heating is known as Javascript. Javascript coordinates the different elements between HTML and CSS.</p>         
  <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Control Flow </h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para"> By default Javascript inputs code from the top down. With control flow however this can be changed. Control flow allows you to choose what code is to be executed and when. Javascript does this through what is called conditional statements and loops. It is easy to understand and visualise this process with the help of a flow chart.

The above is a day to day example of a process that we take when we are hungry. So control flow is all about the order in which code is run. The order of the control flow can execute certain elements of code or even loop over it. This allows it to automate certain tasks or respond to changing conditions. Loops allow for the process of repeating certain tasks with less code. Loops can be used to compile a list of items or used to iterate over an array to perform an action on certain bits of data that are in that array.
  <br></br> Below is a list of certain loops

<br></br>Using control flow makes projects more dynamic, interactive and powerful.

             <h3 class="blog-1-heading">The Dom</h3>  
                <p class="blog-1-para">The Dom stands for  Document Object Model  It is a way that we can change HTML with Javascript. The DOM and HTML are like the same document but in two different languages. The DOM is everything attached to a document and also the ways in which we can interact with it. These changes can be made using methods, sub objects and properties.</p>  
                <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Objects</h3>
                <br>Objects and arrays are known to be a representation of special data that is Mutable; it is used to store a collection of data, not just a single value. 
                Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also store lists of values. Objects are used to represent ‘things’. That thing could be a person, a vehicle or a building or a book. It is anything that can be made up or that can be defined by a set of characteristics called properties. Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation.
                </br>
                
                <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Arrays</h3>
            <br>Arrays are often used to store a list of different items in a single variable. They are very useful when they are used to create ordered collections. To access an item you can access it by whatever its numerical position is on the list. Arrays use what is called a zero-based indexing system, the first item of the array has an index of zero, the second has 1 etc. </br>
                <h3 class="blog-1-heading">Functions</h3> 
                <p class="blog-1-para"> In Javascript a function is similar to a procedure. It is a set of instructions that helps to perform tasks and calculate values. To be a function it takes an input and then gives a certain output.
                    Javascript functions let you give a value to a block of code in which you can execute that particular function as many times as you want to.
