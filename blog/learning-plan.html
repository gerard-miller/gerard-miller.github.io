        <h1 id="main-heading">Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2 class="second-heading">This is my learning plan that will help me along my journey of learning the basics of web development. On this journey I need a mental framework that helps me to continue to progress as different challenges arise.</h2>
            <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para">Although I have an overall goal of trying to get a job as a full time web developer, I need to have manageable day to day goals that help me along this journey. Not trying to take on the world straight away but complete small tasks and take it one hour at a time.  </p>
            <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A description of your own strengths 
                <br>and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para">My strengths in relation to learning are that I am quite good at understanding the big picture of things. In terms of my limitations I tend to overthink things at times and get stuck in inaction. I also am not the best at asking for help. 
                </p>
             <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like 
                 <br>to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p class="blog-1-para">I would like to get better at working in a team and also being more open to people that I don't know. I would like to get better at becoming more efficient and clinical in how I get things done. I would also like to get better at getting things done as well. </p>  
             <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:</h3>  
                <p class="blog-1-para">I plan to manage my workload by working diligently for a solid 9 hour day. Setting goals and a to do list that is manageable for me to achieve each day. I want to get ahead of my workload each week so that I am not cramping and rushing each week to try and get stuff finished. I will call on the help of Facilitators and other students to help me so that when I am stuck I do not spend too long on a problem.</p>  
            <h3 class="blog-1-heading">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</h3> 
                <p class="blog-1-para"> I will search the internet extensively and if the answer can not be found there then i will post on slack and then ask the facilitators.
 </p>     
        <h3 class="blog-1-heading">What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3> 
            <p class="blog-1-para"> I understand that they are extremely busy and that they can not always be there to answer everyone's questions all the time. Although being online it is not always easy when we do not have face to face interactions in which we see other students and facilitators all the time. </p>
